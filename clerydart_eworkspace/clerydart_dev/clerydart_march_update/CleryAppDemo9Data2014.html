				<!--<p>Fifth Panel</p>-->
				<p class="panel_questions"><strong>Challenges </strong></p>
				<p class="panel_answers">Many current students do not know that the daily crime log exists, as there is no mention of the daily crime log in the Department of Safety and Security's <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~security/">website</a> or its <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~security/information/clery-act/">webpage</a> dedicated to the Clery Act, and no information about the crime log their physical office.  There is no mention of the daily crime log in orientation materials</a> for <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~security/docs/welcome_letter_students.pdf">new students</a> and their <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~security/docs/welcome_letter_parents.pdf">families</a>. <br> <br> Other interested parties, such as prospective students, faculty, staff, and the local community are similarly uninformed about the existence of the daily crime log.  <br> <br> The Department of Safety and Security only makes the crime log accessible during typical business hours, despite the fact that the Department of Safety and Security operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. <br> <br> The crime log is only available for inspection on request. <br> <br> Added together, these conditions make the daily crime log inaccessible to students and to the general public.

				<p class="panel_questions"><strong>What does the Clery Act say about an online crime log?</strong></p>
				<ul><a href="http://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/handbook.pdf">The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting</a> published by the U.S. Department of Education has a section on "Making Your Log Available" on page 89:
							<li><p> "Format: Your log may be either hard copy or 
							<strong>electronic</strong>. If your institution has an electronic log 
							and there are technical problems that make it 
							unusable, <strong>use a hard copy log as a temporary 
							replacement until the problems are resolved</strong>."
							</p></li>
							<li><p> "Publicize Availability: <strong>Let students and employees 
							know that the log is available, what it contains and 
							where it is. </strong> You may post a notice on your website, in 
							your security office, in your student and employee 
							handbooks or anywhere else it's likely to be seen."
							</p></li>
							<li><p>
							"Accessibility: The crime log for the most recent 60-
							day period must be open to public inspection, upon 
							request, during normal business hours. You cannot 													   require a written request. <strong>Anyone may have access to 
							the log, whether or not they are associated with your 
							institution. This includes the media. </strong>Make any 
							portion of the log that is older than 60 days available 
							within two business days of a request for public 
							inspection."
