# Provides directions on updating CleryDart

1. Type up data from the Daily Crime Log; place it in a spreadsheet broken up into the "Type of Crime", "Date
Occurred", etc. columns.  
2. Once the data has been entered, sort the columns by type of crime committed; this will help in creating the
"Crimes" Legend.  
3. Export the file as a .csv file.
4. Make sure all of the locations have coordinates in the current campus_coordinates .csv file.  This
file creates a "Campus Locations" dictionary in Python that the clerydart_template.py program uses to
plot locations.  If certain locations do not have coordinates, look them up in OpenStreetMap and add 
them to the campus_coordinates gnumeric file.  Then export the new computer_coordinates file as a .csv.
5. Open eclipse, drag the newly created .csv files into the project folder.  
6. Update the clerydart_template.py program by updating the titles of the two .csv files to the ones you 
just created.  Update the name of the file that Folium exports.
7.  Run the clerydart_template.py program.
8.  Open the new .html file that is created by Folium; check to make sure it works.
9.  Open the new .html file in vim.
