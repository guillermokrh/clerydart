1. Type up data from the Daily Crime Log; place it in a spreadsheet broken up into the "Type of Crime", "Date
Occurred", etc. columns.  
2. Once the data has been entered, sort the columns by type of crime committed; this will help in creating the
"Crimes" Legend.  
3.  Export the file as a .csv file.
4. Open eclipse, drag the newly created .csv file into the project folder.  
5. Update the basic_template.py program by updating the .csv title to the one you created.
