# Provides directions on updating CleryDart

1. Type up data from the Daily Crime Log; place it in a spreadsheet broken up into the "Type of Crime", "Date
Occurred", etc. columns.  
2. Once the data has been entered, sort the columns by type of crime committed; this will help in creating the
"Crimes" Legend.  
3. Export the file as a .csv file.
4. Make sure all of the locations have coordinates in the current campus_coordinates .csv file.  This
file creates a "Campus Locations" dictionary in Python that the clerydart_template.py program uses to
plot locations.  If certain locations do not have coordinates, look them up in OpenStreetMap and add 
them to the campus_coordinates gnumeric file.  Then export the new computer_coordinates file as a .csv.
5. Open eclipse, drag the newly created .csv files into the project folder.  
6. Update the clerydart_template.py program by updating the titles of the two .csv files to the ones you 
just created.  Update the name of the file that Folium exports.
7.  Run the clerydart_template.py program.
8.  Open the new .html file that is created by Folium; check to make sure it works.
9.  Open the new .html file in vim; erase the individual marker layers that were created by Folium.*
10.  Check the different types of crime layers, add any new layer groups (types of crimes) that 
need to be added, for example "Violation of Privacy".
11.  Run the prints_variables.py program to print all the names of markers, copy and paste the new
marker variables to the crimes layers.   
12. Copy and paste the prints_crime_occurrences.js code into the .html .js code, in order to count
how much of each crime type there is.  Open the .html file, and look at the console to see the print-out.
Copy and paste the print-outs to the layers legend control.
