Purpose: Outline next steps for CleryDart 


1. Already have a Python script that will generate a Leaflet template for HTML.
2. Collect campus crime data from campus security department - Done, from May 10th to July 18th 7/18/14
3. Create a "Crimes_Input" spreadsheet, enter the crime data, export it as .csv file. - Done, still have to export as .csv 7/18/14 Done exporting as .csv 7/20/14
4. Create a "Campus_Locations" spreadsheet - Done 7/18/14-7/19/14
5. Determine a good center coordinate for each campus location, enter the coordinates, export it as a .csv file - Done, still have to export as .csv 7/18/14-7/19/14 - Done exporting as .csv 7/20/14
6. Run the Python script to generate the Leaflet HTML template - Done 7/20/14
7. Enter the JavaScript hack that allows multiple popups to be open in Leaflet - Done 7/22/14

8. Insert the HTML formatting and text from the last CleryDart update to the new Leaflet HTML template. - Done 7/22/14
9. Make the previous edition of the CleryDart website a page that visitors can visit from the new CleryDart home page

10. Update the writing (copy) on the website.  - Done before 7/22/14
11. Update the CSS  

12. Write a request for input: email _______ for constructive feedback on the website - Done 7/17/2014
13. Write a request for support.
14. Note what I need for additional features.    

15. Post July Update to CleryDart: - Done 7/22/14

16.  Change the rounded corners of the .css design for the about paragraphs - Done 7/24/14
17.  Figure out a sustainable way to create the map legend.
		Quick Fix (not sustainable but it'll do for now):
		17a. Sort the Gnumeric form by type of crime, not by date - done 7/24/14
		17b. Marker variables created by the Python script will be grouped by type of crime - done 7/24/14
		17c. Create a quick array in JS that will group the types of crimes together
		17d. Use that list to create a layer on Leaflet
18.  Make the zoom buttons on the Leaflet map bigger
19. Make the markers on the Leaflet map smaller - use MarkerCluster for this
20.  Make marker area larger for larger buildings on campus, which will reduce overlapping markers
21.  Reduce text on the homepage.

22. Post link to my github on the CleryDart homepage - done 7/24/2014
23. Look into licensing options.
24. Test Github for Mac - done 7/31/14

25. Get Folium to not add each marker as a separate layer! - done manually for July and August updates, I want to modify
the Folium code itself.

26. Figure out way to build app that is native to JS, can do authentication, can take data straight from .csv files,
and plot it onto a Leaflet map.  
	Needs: 
		- S&S authentication, direct from .csv sheets, no typing in 
		- possible "crime region" alerts
		- add in where the blue warning systems are 
		- color code the markers, make them smaller
		- possible electricity down alerts
		- solve the "unknown location" problem, not put it in the Green
		- potentially use Rails instead of JS?  Look into this	
27. Clean up CleryDart file directory - done
28. Post August update - done August 13, 2014.
29. Add section on how crime statistics are compiled by S&S.
