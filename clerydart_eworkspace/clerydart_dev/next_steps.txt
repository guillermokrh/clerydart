Purpose: Outline next steps for CleryDart 


1. Already have a Python script that will generate a Leaflet template for HTML.
2. Collect campus crime data from campus security department - Done, from May 10th to July 18th 7/18/14
3. Create a "Crimes_Input" spreadsheet, enter the crime data, export it as .csv file. - Done, still have to export as .csv 7/18/14 Done exporting as .csv 7/20/14
4. Create a "Campus_Locations" spreadsheet - Done 7/18/14-7/19/14
5. Determine a good center coordinate for each campus location, enter the coordinates, export it as a .csv file - Done, still have to export as .csv 7/18/14-7/19/14 - Done exporting as .csv 7/20/14
6. Run the Python script to generate the Leaflet HTML template - Done 7/20/14
7. Enter the JavaScript hack that allows multiple popups to be open in Leaflet - Done 7/22/14

8. Insert the HTML formatting and text from the last CleryDart update to the new Leaflet HTML template. - Done 7/22/14

12. Write a request for input: email _______ for constructive feedback on the website - Done 7/17/2014
13. Write a request for support.
14. Note what I need for additional features.    

15. Post July Update to CleryDart: - Done 7/22/14

16.  Change the rounded corners of the .css design for the about paragraphs - Done 7/24/14
17.  Figure out a sustainable way to create the map legend.
		Quick Fix (not sustainable but it'll do for now):
		17a. Sort the Gnumeric form by type of crime, not by date - done 7/24/14
		17b. Marker variables created by the Python script will be grouped by type of crime - done 7/24/14
		17c. Create a quick array in JS that will group the types of crimes together
		17d. Use that list to create a layer on Leaflet
18.  Make the zoom buttons on the Leaflet map bigger
19. Make the markers on the Leaflet map smaller
20.  Make marker area larger for larger buildings on campus, which will reduce overlapping markers
21.  Reduce text on the homepage.

22. Post link to my github on the CleryDart homepage - done 7/24/2014
23. Look into licensing options.
24. Test Github for Mac

25. Get Folium to not add each marker as a separate layer!
